## Binary Search Tree

BST is a data structure consisting of nodes containing data with left and right
pointers both of which points either to a other node or nil and when BST is
balanced meaning its root is almost a middle value and for each node its left
subtree/node is of smaller value and right subtree/node is bigger, it looks
like a tree.

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

```plaintext
â”œâ”€â”€ lib

â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ helpers
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ helpers.rb

â””â”€â”€ main.rb // just a file i used for testing my trees
```

## ðŸ›  Features

- `#insert(value)` - inserts a new node with given value into the tree.
- `#delete(value)` - deletes a node with given value from the tree.
- `#find(value)` - finds returns the node in the tree with the given value.
- `#level_order` - breadth-first-search tree traversal.

---

### breadth-first-search

- `#inorder` -  traverse the tree in preorder DLR.
- `#preorder` - traverse the tree in inorder LDR.
- `#postorder` - traverse the tree in postorder LRD.

---

- `#height(node)` - returns the height of the given node (number of edges in
longest path from the node to a leaf node)
- `#depth(target)` - returns the depth of the target node (number of edge in
path from the node to the tree's root)
- `#balanced?` - returns `true` if the tree is balanced.
- `#rebalance` - rebalances tree.
